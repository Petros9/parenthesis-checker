## VirtusLab recruitment project

This project is a small recruitment exercise, which purpose is to help us with
choosing interns for this year's summer internship program. The
most important thing in this exercise is to work on it using all the best practices
that you know. Essentially:

- remember it's a git repository, you can use it to make it easier for the
  company employees to check your code
- make sure everything is properly tested
- you can use any approach you want, functional, object oriented - you name it -
  you can try to make it more interesting or alternatively follow some classic
  programming techniques. Both are important, to be innovative and to be clear
  in your intent.

The task for you is to implement a checker that shows the user whether a
provided Scala code snippet contains the proper number of parenthesis: `(` and
`)`. You can find the main entrypoint in
`src/main/scala/com/virtuslab/Main.scala` together with the assignment details.
We also included a couple of example code snippets in the `code-samples`
directory.

We included some basic libraries in the project, but you can use any alternative
ones that you prefer. We also included a small coursier runnable jar, which will
require Java JDK to run. Using it you can install all the needed software such
as the sbt build tool, which is used in the project, using:

`./coursier install sbt`

sbt will allow you to run and test your code from commandline.

If you don't have java JDK on you system it can also be setup easily using
[coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-setup)

Alternatively you can use recommended code editors such as:

- [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
  [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode.html) plugin.

Please send the code back in an archive together with `.git` directory.

Remember that it's not only the solution that we are interested in, but also how
you approach it.

### Good luck and happy coding!
